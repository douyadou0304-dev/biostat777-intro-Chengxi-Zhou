    "section": "Conclusion and Discussion",
    "text": "Conclusion and Discussion\nThis analysis provides an overview of global plastic waste distribution by country, company, and material type using open-source data from the TidyTuesday dataset. The results highlight that plastic pollution is heavily concentrated in a few countries and dominated by consumer packaging materials such as PET and LDPE. Major global brands continue to contribute significantly to the problem.\nHowever, the analysis is limited by the short time frame (2019–2020) and the lack of granular data on recycling efforts or waste policy changes. Future studies could integrate time-series data over longer periods or explore the relationship between economic development and waste generation to design more effective global plastic reduction strategies.\nFigure 1 shows that Taiwan, Nigeria, and the Philippines are among the highest plastic waste–producing countries between 2019 and 2020. This indicates that developing countries in Asia and Africa contribute significantly to global plastic waste generation, possibly due to limited waste management infrastructure.\nFigure 2 illustrates the temporal trend of plastic waste generation. While the overall waste decreased slightly from 2019 to 2020, India and the Philippines show contrasting patterns, suggesting different national responses to waste management during this period.\nFigure 3 presents the faceted trends of plastic waste generation by country, allowing a clearer comparison between nations and satisfying the faceting requirement through facet_wrap().\nFigure 4 highlights the top plastic-polluting companies, with “Grand Total” and “Unbranded” indicating large proportions of untraceable waste, followed by The Coca-Cola Company. This finding suggests that consumer goods industries remain key contributors to global plastic pollution.\nFigure 5 presents the global composition of plastic waste by material type. PET, LDPE, and PP account for the majority of collected waste, reflecting their widespread use in packaging, bags, and bottles.\nFigure 6 visualizes the same composition as a pie chart, providing a clear representation of the dominance of PET and LDPE in the overall plastic waste composition.\nOverall, this analysis demonstrates the importance of transparent brand audits and open-source environmental data in understanding global waste patterns, and how visualization tools in R — such as ggplot2 and the tidyverse ecosystem — can effectively communicate these findings to both policymakers and the public Wickham (2016) Wickham, Averick, et al. (2019)."
