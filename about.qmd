# About Me

## Education
I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University.  
Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Biology with a minor in Mathematics at Georgia State University.  
My undergraduate training provided me with a solid foundation in life sciences and analytical thinking, which later inspired me to bridge biology with quantitative analysis.

## Personal Background
I come from Chengdu, China—a city known for its spicy hotpot, vibrant culture, and relaxed lifestyle.  
Growing up in such an energetic and flavorful city, I developed a strong appreciation for creativity and open-mindedness.  
I’m a dog person who loves spicy food, watching movies, traveling, and spending time with friends.  
Chengdu’s warm and lively spirit continues to influence the way I approach both life and learning.

## Academic Interests
During my undergraduate studies, I first engaged in biological experiments related to virology, which introduced me to the fascinating world of research.  
As I became more interested in data interpretation, I realized how statistical methods could help uncover meaningful insights behind biological phenomena.  
This realization led me to shift my focus toward biostatistics, where I could combine my biological background with quantitative analysis to study complex public health questions.  
My recent research involves exploring survival analysis and its applications in disease-related studies.

## Future Goals
Looking ahead, I aim to further strengthen my ability to apply advanced statistical techniques to biomedical data and contribute to interdisciplinary research in biostatistics and epidemiology.  
Ultimately, I hope to bridge statistical reasoning and real-world health challenges to support data-driven public health decision-making.
